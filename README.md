# Congruence Game - &#8484;/5&#8484;

Played like 2048, but numbers combine when they are congruent modulo 5, ie: a &#8801; b (mod 5). a and b combine when a and b have the same remainder when divided by 5.

The game needs a little polish and some extra mechanics (power-ups) given its different feel. But, this is a start.
